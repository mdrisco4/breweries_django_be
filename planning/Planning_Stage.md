#Rough Outline of Project Idea
###Idea
With a relatively simple layout build a site for a local craft beer community that users can go to for menus, beer lists for individual taphouses and a way to look through what food and beer is offered in the area overall.  Future planning includes recipes, comments and events.
###Conception
I aim to build a site that starts wityh a home page with logos, hours, addresses, etc. of brewhouses in the area for visitors and more involved capabilities for those with specific tastes looking for certain products or styles.
###Planned Steps
Start with a Django backend and determine whether it is best to build a React frontend or use Django templates.  Continue to build frontend with full CRUD capabilities and include a useer authentication system.  Get deployed and work on style and increased functionality.
###Other
Integrate any other ideas that are deemed beneficialo to the platform.
